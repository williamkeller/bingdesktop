# Bing Desktop

My wife is forced to use IE and Bing at work, and apart from the general
awfulness of the situation, she has come to really enjoy the Bing
picture of the day. So I made her a script to fetch the picture of the
day and install it as her screen background.

This solution is very specific to OSX. Perhaps one day I'll look at
running this on other operating systems. 

net.arda.bingdesktop.plist needs to be copied to ~/Library/LaunchAgent
for the script to run automatically.
